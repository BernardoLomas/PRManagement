. When records are lost, age is guessed based on experience.

> 2.4 Health Management
. Health treatments and diseases are written in notebooks.
. There is no historical health overview per pigeon.
. Information may be lost over time.

> 2.5 Training & Performance
. Training routines are planned daily.
. Performance is evaluated informally, without structured historical comparison.
. Decisions rely heavily on intuition.
