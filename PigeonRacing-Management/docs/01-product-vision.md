## 01 - Product vision - Pigeon Racing Management System (PRMS)

1. What problem does this system solve?
   In Brazil, especially in the state of Minas Gerais, many pigeon breeders still rely on paper notes, spreadsheets, or memory to manage their dovecotes. There is a lack of accessible, modern, and localized software to organize breeding, records, and general management activies. The Pigeon Racing Management System (PRMS) exists to professionalize and centralize the management of pigeon racing operations, making them more efficient, realiable, and organized.

2. Who is the user?
   The system targets two main user profiles:
   . Experienced and large-scale breeders who want to optimize their dovecotes and prepare for competitions in a more structured way.
   . Small and medium breeders who want to manage their pigeons without relying on paper, notebooks, or complex foreign systems.

3. Why does this problem matter?
   This problem matters because pigeon breeding is an active and growing hobby in Brazil, yet breeders lack a national solution tailored to their reality. Existing tools are either outdated or foreign, creating barriers related to language, cost, and support. Without proper tools, breeders face disorganization, data loss, and ineffiecient management.

4. What happens today without the system?
   Today, many breeders are forced to use European systems or manual methods to manage their dovecotes. These solutions are often expensive, difficult to use, not adapted to Brazilian pigeon racing practices, and offer no local support, making adoption and long-term usage challenging.

5. What will be better with the system?
   With PRMS, breeders will have access to an affordable, modern, and Brazilian-focused management system. The platform will offer Portuguese language support, local assistance, and features designed specifically for pigeon racing in Brazil, allowing breeders to manage their dovecotes with more control, clarity, and professionalism.
