## 06 - MVP Scope (Draft) - Pigeon Racing Management System (PRMS)

1. MVP Goal 
> The MVP of PRMS exists to help professional pigeon breeders organize pigeon data and lineage in one place, reducing data loss and improving confidence in daily breeding decisions.

> Why this is a good MVP goal:
. Clear
. User-centered
. Focused on one main value
. No buzzwords

2. Primary User for MVP
> Primary persona: Professional pigeon breeder

> Why this persona comes first:
. Has the strongest pain points
. Is more willing to pay
. Uses the system frequently
. Feels real financial and competitive impact

> Intentionally not the focus right now:
. Hobby breeders
. Club / association administrators

3. Core Problems the MVP Must Solve
> The MVP must solve these problems only:
. Loss of pigeon information stored on paper or spreadsheets
. Difficulty tracking lineage and breeding history
. Uncertainty when choosing breeding pairs
. Lack of centralized and reliable pigeon records
. Stress caused by disorganization and missing data

4. MVP Features 
> These features are non-negotiable for the MVP:
. User account for each breeder
. Ability to register pigeons with basic information
. Identification (ring, sex)
. Birth year / ring year
. Ability to register parent lineage
. View a list of pigeons in the dovecote
. Ability to update pigeon information
. Basic data persistence and backup

> Nice to Have 
. Simple health notes per pigeon
. Simple breeding history notes
. Basic search and filtering of pigeons

> Not Now 
. Competition management
. Pigeon negotiation / marketplace
. Advanced statistics and analytics
. Financial management
. AI-based suggestions
. Social features between breeders

5. MVP Success Criteria
> From the user’s perspective, the MVP is successful if:
. The breeder uses the system daily or weekly
. The breeder stops relying on notebooks or spreadsheets
. The breeder feels confident that pigeon data will not be lost

> The breeder says:
“Now I know where everything is.”

> The MVP fails if:
. Users stop using it after a few days
. Data feels unreliable
. The system feels confusing or slow

6. MVP Constraints
> Team: Solo developer

> Time: Limited availability alongside studies/work

> Budget: Minimal or zero infrastructure cost at the beginning

> Technical:
. Web-only
. No offline mode
. Simple authentication

7. What the MVP Will NOT Do
> The MVP will explicitly NOT:
. Replace competition management systems
. Automate breeding decisions
. Provide financial or accounting features
. Support multiple countries or languages
. Offer advanced dashboards or reports

8. Assumptions to Validate After MVP
> These assumptions must be tested, not trusted blindly:
. Professional breeders are willing to pay for organization alone
. Lineage tracking is the strongest perceived value
. Users prefer simplicity over many features
. Mobile usage is more important than desktop
. Monthly subscription is acceptable
