## 02 - Problem and context - Pigeon Racing Management System (PRMS)

## Market context
1. Where does pigeons racing take place in Brazil?
   Pigeon racing exists across the entire country, with stronger presence in the Southeast region. Many breeders in this region are descendants of Europeans who brought the sport to Brazil. Minas Gerais stands out as the state with the largest number of breeders, with an estimated 350 professional breeders and more than 2,000 registered participants.

2. Is it a professional activity, a hobby, or both?
   It is both. Most breeders treat pigeon racing as a hobby; however, a significant portion of the community manages their dovecotes in a professional way, especially those involved in competitions.

3. How common is technology usage among breeders?
   Technology usage is not common. During early planning interviews, a real user involved in the development stated: “It is not common. Most breeders do not use any kind of technology solution in their dovecotes.” - Alex Lomas de Souza Ameno, President of the Pigeon Racing Club of Betim.

4. Are there asssociations, clubs, or competitions?
   Brazil has a national federation responsible for pigeon racing activities. At the state level, especially in Minas Gerais, several local clubs organize competitions and operate with their own internal rules.

## Current alternative
1. How do breeders manage their dovecotes today?
   Most breeders manage their dovecotes manually using paper notes, spreadsheets, or personal memory. In some cases, Excel sheets are used, but there is no automation or centralized system. 

2. What foreign systems are commonly used?
   Some breeders use foreign systems such as LoftGest, Pyperion and Animal Manager.

3. What are the main drawbacks of these alternatives?
   Although these systems offer solid administrative features, they are often outdated, difficult to use, expensive, not intuitive, and provide slow or limited support. Additionally, they are not adapted to the Brazilian context and offer limited scalability for future technologies such as artificial intelligence.

4. Why don't all breeders use them?
  Most breeders are older and not comfortable adopting foreign technologies. Additionally, these systems are expensive, and adoption is harder when there is no local community using the same tools.

## Regional and cultural constraints
1. Language barries
   The system must be available in Portuguese as a priority.

2. Cost sensitivity
   The solution must be more affordable than foreign alternatives while offering better support.

3. Internet access
   As a web application, stable internet access is required.

4. Local pigeon racing rules or practices
   The system must adapt to the rules of different clubs or associations, potentially allowing users to associate their account with a specific organization.

## Economic Context
1. Are breeders willing to pay for software?
   Not all breeders are willing to pay. However, competitive and professional users are more likely to invest in a system that helps them improve results.

2. One-time payment vs subscription?
   A subscription model appears more acceptable. For example, a monthly fee feels more accessible than a high one-time payment for long-term access.

3. What feels "expensive" vs "affordable"?
   A monthly subscription between R$100 and R$200 may be perceived as affordable for a specialized system in a niche sport that currently lacks a national solution.


## Why existing solutions fail this market
1. What do foreign systems get wrong?
   Foreign systems are not adapted to the Brazilian reality.

2. What do generic farm/animal systems miss?
   Generic animal or farm management systems do not address the specific needs of pigeon racing.

3. Why spreadsheets and paper persist?
   Paper and spreadsheets persist because they are free, familiar, and give a false sense of organization.

## Opportunity statement
   There is an opportunity to build PRMS because Brazil has a large and active pigeon racing community that lacks a modern, specialized, and national management system. While some breeders use foreign solutions, these tools are expensive, outdated, and poorly adapted to local needs. PRMS can fill this gap by offering a modern, scalable, and Brazil-focused platform.
